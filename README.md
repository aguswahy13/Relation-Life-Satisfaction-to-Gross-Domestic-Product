# Relation Life Satisfaction to Gross Domestic Product

Life satisfaction dataset can be obtained in [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI) and gross domestic product (GDP) every country can be obtained [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD), this used data in year 2020.

This process included
1. Filtering Dataset
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Processing
5. Data Visualization
6. Linear Regression Using Scikit-Learn
7. k-Nearest Neighbors Regression
8. Predicting the Life satisfaction Value
9. Comparing Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors

The objective is to find a model that fit the data in linear regression and k-nearest neighbors model, then predicting the Life satisfaction value that country not listed in OECD. Also, compare the result with two different model what is the best one and how closest each model to fit the data.
